# Business Deployment Guide for Serene Flow Spa Suite

This document outlines the standard business deployment procedures for the Serene Flow Spa Suite application using the Vercel platform.

## Deployment Scripts and Tools

The primary deployment script for business use is `deploy-business-app.ps1`. This script provides a robust, professional-grade deployment workflow with logging, verification, and environment-specific configurations.

### Available Deployment Environments

- **Production**: Live customer-facing environment
- **Staging**: Pre-production testing environment
- **Development**: Development and internal testing environment

## Standard Deployment Procedures

### 1. Regular Production Deployment

For standard production deployments (e.g., feature releases, scheduled updates):

```powershell
.\deploy-business-app.ps1 -Environment production
```

This will:
- Verify your project
- Create a backup of critical files
- Configure production environment variables
- Deploy to Vercel's production environment
- Run post-deployment verification

### 2. Emergency Hotfix Deployment

For urgent fixes that need to bypass standard verification:

```powershell
.\deploy-business-app.ps1 -Environment production -SkipVerification -Force
```

This will:
- Skip the usual verification steps
- Force the deployment even if there are warnings
- Deploy to production immediately

### 3. Staging Deployment for Testing

For testing in a production-like environment before going live:

```powershell
.\deploy-business-app.ps1 -Environment staging
```

### 4. Development Deployment

For sharing work with the team or stakeholders:

```powershell
.\deploy-business-app.ps1 -Environment development
```

## Deployment Logs and Monitoring

All deployments are logged in the `deployment-logs` directory with timestamps. These logs should be retained for audit purposes and troubleshooting.

Example log file: `deployment-logs/20250523-153000-deploy.log`

## Backup and Recovery

Before each deployment, the system automatically creates backups in the `deployment-backups` directory. These backups include:

- `vercel.json` configuration
- `.env` files
- `.vercel` project linking information

If a deployment fails, you can restore these backups manually.

## Database Considerations

The Serene Flow Spa Suite application requires a PostgreSQL database. For optimal cost and performance:

1. For **Production**: Use a professional PostgreSQL service that offers:
   - High availability
   - Automated backups
   - Security features (encryption, IP restrictions)

2. For **Staging/Development**: Use Vercel's integrated database options:
   - Neon Serverless Postgres (recommended)
   - Supabase (for development with auth needs)

## Security Guidelines

When deploying to production:

1. Always review environment variables before deployment
2. Do not store sensitive credentials in script files
3. Ensure proper SSL/HTTPS configuration
4. Review Vercel's access permissions regularly

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### 1. "DEPLOYMENT_NOT_FOUND" Error

If you encounter this error:

```powershell
.\fix-vercel-not-found.ps1 -Force
```

### 2. Database Connection Issues

Verify the correct DATABASE_URL environment variable is set:

```powershell
npx vercel env ls
```

### 3. API Endpoint Failures

Check the API logs and ensure environment variables are correctly set:

```powershell
.\verify-all.ps1 -ApiOnly
```

## Deployment Schedule and Standards

- **Regular updates**: Schedule for off-peak hours (recommended: Tuesdays and Thursdays, 7-9 AM)
- **Feature releases**: Minimum 24-hour notice to stakeholders
- **Hotfixes**: Can be deployed as needed with proper documentation
- **Database migrations**: Require backup verification before proceeding
