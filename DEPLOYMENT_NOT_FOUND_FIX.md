# Vercel Deployment Fix Documentation

This document outlines the process for resolving the `DEPLOYMENT_NOT_FOUND` error in Vercel deployments and provides instructions for maintaining a stable deployment.

## Common Causes of DEPLOYMENT_NOT_FOUND

The `DEPLOYMENT_NOT_FOUND` error typically occurs for the following reasons:

1. **Deleted or Expired Deployment:** The deployment has been deleted from the Vercel platform or has expired.
2. **Project Link Issues:** The project is not correctly linked to your Vercel account or organization.
3. **DNS Configuration Problems:** The custom domain or subdomain is not properly configured.
4. **Build Failure:** A critical build failure prevented proper deployment.

## Fix Procedure

We've created several scripts to detect and fix Vercel deployment issues:

### Quick Fix Script

The `fix-vercel-not-found.ps1` script handles the specific `DEPLOYMENT_NOT_FOUND` error:

```powershell
.\fix-vercel-not-found.ps1
```

This script:

1. Verifies Vercel CLI installation
2. Ensures proper authentication
3. Checks project linking
4. Updates environment variables
5. Forces a new production deployment
6. Creates emergency fallback files if needed

For more severe cases, use:

```powershell
.\fix-vercel-not-found.ps1 -Force
```

### Comprehensive Fix

For more general deployment issues, use:

```powershell
.\fix-vercel-deployment.ps1
```

This script performs a more comprehensive verification and repair process.

### Verification Script

To verify that your deployment is working correctly:

```powershell
.\verify-vercel-deployment.ps1 -Url "https://your-app-url.vercel.app" -Detailed
```

## Fallback System Implementation

Our deployment system now includes several fallback options to prevent the `DEPLOYMENT_NOT_FOUND` error:

1. **Fallback API Handlers:** The API system uses fallback handlers if the main handler fails.
2. **Emergency Build Pages:** If the build fails, an informative maintenance page is displayed.
3. **Static Asset Fallbacks:** Critical static assets have fallbacks for resilience.

## Preventive Measures

To avoid encountering this error in the future:

1. Always use our deployment scripts: `.\deploy-to-vercel.ps1`
2. Verify deployments with: `.\verify-vercel-deployment.ps1`
3. Keep the Vercel project linked via `.vercel/project.json`
4. Maintain proper environment variables in the Vercel dashboard
5. Run the verification report generator after deployments

## Support

If you continue to experience issues after following these procedures, please contact the development team with:

1. The verification report (generated by `.\generate-verification-report.ps1`)
2. Your Vercel project name
3. The complete error message from the Vercel dashboard
